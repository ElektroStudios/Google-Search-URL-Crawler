# Google Search URL Crawler

### A desktop application that crawls urls from Google's search engine results.

------------------

# ‚ÄºÔ∏è Limitations

This software makes free usage of Google's search engine via html scraping techniques, it does not use specialized (Google) APIs, so the program is limited to send a small amount of queries per hour until Google start denying any new requests. Blame on Google policy, not this program.
