# **Google Search URL Crawler**

![](Images/App.png)

**Google Search URL Crawler** is a desktop application that allows you to crawl urls from Google's search engine results.

# Limitations

This program makes free usage of Google's search engine via html scraping techniques, so the program is limited to send a small amount of queries per hour until Google start denying any new requests. Blame on Google policy, not this program.
